# Doc-Directory

Doc-Directory is a user-friendly platform designed to simplify the process of finding, filtering, and booking appointments with healthcare professionals. With a focus on streamlining the connection between users and doctors, Doc-Directory offers a comprehensive solution for individuals seeking medical care.

## User Profiles and Appointments
Users can create profiles containing personal information and book appointments with their preferred doctor.

## Doctor Side
Doctors have the capability to make notes based on appointments with patients. These notes are linked to patient profiles for future reference. Additionally, doctors can access the medical history of patients.

## Patient Side
Patients, after appointments, have the option to rate their experience with the clinic and healthcare provider. This approach aims to make the booking process more accessible, eliminating the need to call in and wait on hold with reception.

## Accessibility and Transparency
The goal of the project is to make the healthcare management process more accessible for patients and transparent for both patients and healthcare providers. This is achieved through features like appointment notes history.
